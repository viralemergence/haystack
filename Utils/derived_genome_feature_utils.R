## Zoonosis predictor: utility functions for calculating derived genome features
library(EnvStats)

## Calculate distances between virus and host features (i.e. distance from host optimum)
#  - weightBy is optional, but when given should be a vector with same length as geneFeatures, 
#  	 specifying a variable to use for weighting geneFeature observations. 
#  	 This should be in raw form to allow NA values in geneFeatures to be accommodated.
#  - featureColNames is a list of column names (in both virusFeatures and geneFeatures) for
#    which distances should be calculated
#  - setprefix is the abbreviation to be used to identify feature columns (using the format:
#     <..DistanceType..>_<..setprefix..>_<..feature..>)

	# (actually the density given the human distribution)
